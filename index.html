        <p>You have probably heard that the closer you are to the equator, the hotter the temperature is.  Does this hold true?  If so, does the proximity to the equator also affect other weather-related variables.  On this website you can examine how the proximity to the equator affects: 
            <ul>
                <li>(Max) Temperature</li>
                <li>Humidity</li>
                <li>Cloudiness</li>
                <li>Wind Speed</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

            We pulled data on over 500 cities from the <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api" target="blank">OpenWeatherMap API</a>.  The full list of cities and all relevant data can be found <a href="" target="blank">here</a>.  After retrieving the data, we used the <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/" target="blank">python library pandas</a> to organize the data into a dataframe.  Thereafter we used the <a href="https://matplotlib.org/" target="blank">python library Matplotlib</a> to plot selected columns from our dataframe, and thereby visually analyze whether there are any relationships between the weather-related variables.
